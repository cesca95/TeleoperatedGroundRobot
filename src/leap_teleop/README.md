## Objective of the Project

## The Systemâ€™s Architecture

### Overall Architecture
It describes what the project wants to achieve and defines the key terminologies of this project. Presents the hardware or tools used in the project.

### Description of the Modules
#### Feature Leap Motion Teleoperation
This branch is about creating a project to teleoperate a robot using a Leap Motion controller with hand gestures.

##### Inputs

Hand and fingers motions.

##### Internal working

Images taken by two cameras are analyzed to reconctruct a 3D representation of what the device sees. Tracking algorithms interprat the 3D data and infer the pitch and the roll of occluded objects. Tresholds for commands are:
  * pitch
  -50 to -20 degrees
  * roll
  -100 to -50 and 80 to 130 degrees
##### Outputs
Outputs are commands for robot. When gesture command will be in pitch treshold, value 0.5 (move forward) will be send to robot. When gesture command will be in lower treshold of roll, value -0.5 (turn right) will be send to robot. Value 0.5 (turn left) will be send when gesture command will be in higher tershold for roll.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites
* Leap Motion controller
* USB cabel
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* ROS Kinectic
* Leap Motion SDK

### How to run the project
#### Download and installation of Leap Motion SDK
1. Download Leap Motion SDK in Ubuntu form [here](https://www.leapmotion.com/setup/linux)
2. Open Terminal on the extracted location and install the DEB using: 

    ```
    sudp dpkg -install Leap-*-x64.deb
    ```

More detailed installation and debugging are [here](https://support.leapmotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/223782608-Linux-Installation)

3. Open Terminal and execute the command to verify that device is properly detected on Ubuntu

    ```
    dmesg
    ```
    
4. Invoke Leap Motion controller manager by ececuting the following command:

    ```
    sudo LeapControlPanel
    ```

5. If you want to start just driver, you can use the following command:

    ```
    sudo leapd
    ```
    
6. Use this command to restart the driver

    ```
    sudo service leapd stop
    ```
    
#### Installin the ROS driver for the Leap Motion controller
1. Download ROS driver

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/leap_motion
    ```
    
2. Set the path of the Leap Motion SDK in the .bashrc file. Assuming that the Leap SDK is in the user's home folder with the name LeapSDK, we have to set the path variable in .bashrc as follows.

    ```
    export LEAP_SDK=$LEAP_SDK:$HOME/LeapSDK
    ```
    
3.  We also have to add the path of the Python extension of the Leap Motion SDK to .bashrc.

    ```
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/LeapSDK/lib:$HOME/LeapSDK/lib/x64
    ```
    
4. In new terminal copy the libLeap.so file to /usr/local/lib. Here is how we do it:

    ```
    sudo cp $LEAP_SDK/lib/x64/libLeap.so /usr/local/lib 
    ```
    
5. After copying, execute ldconfig:

    ```
    sudo ldconfig
    ```
    
6. Create a ROS workspace or copy the leap_motion package to an existing ROS workspace and use catkin_make
You can use the following command to install the leap_motion package:

    ```
    catkin_make install --pkg leap_motion
    ```
    
#### Running
Terminal 0: 

    
     sudo LeapControlPanel
   
    
Terminal 1: 

      roscore
      
Terminal 2: 

      roslaunch leap_motion sensor_sender.launch
      
Terminal 3: 

      rosrun leap_teleop leap_teleop.py
      
Terminal 4: 

      rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

#### Testing
Terminal 5: 

      rostopic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel
      rostopic echo /orientation

## Results

## Recommendations
Limitations from sensors, accuracy of the hand gesture detection by user-defined tresholds. 
ideas: calibrate range of tresholds addording to each user.

The Recommendations follow naturally from the conclusions. They describe: the assumptions made while building the system (and/or) the limitations of the working system. Therefore, presenting possible ideas that could overcome the limitations or assumptions.

# hrp_teleoperation_old

After cloning the repository type in ~/hrp_teleoperation

git submodule init

and

git submodule update

This commands will link to the submodules and pull all the relative code

In order to use the rgbdslam module follow the instructions at this link:(changed to rtabmap)

https://hubpages.com/technology/Instructions-for-compiling-rgbdslam-v2-on-a-fresh-Ubuntu-1604-install-ros-kinetic-in-virtualbox


http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros

In order to install and launch rtabmap:

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rtabmap-ros

Modify in /opt/ros/kinetic/share/rtabmap_ros/launch the file rtabmap.launch
at row 21 set default = false, at row 22 set deafault = true in order to open the pointcloud map with rviz.

Launch rtabmap:
roscore

roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch depth_registration:=true

roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"


pointcloud topic:  /rtabmap/mapData     type:  rtabmap_ros/MapData


run the websocket with: roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
